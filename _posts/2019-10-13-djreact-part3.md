This week I have been reviewing the next video in the Django and React Tutorial series by JustDjango on Youtube. This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxzO2M7QcZw&t=45s reviews how to authenticate users with React and Django. I am familiar with authenticating users using Django but using React and Redux is new territory for me.
