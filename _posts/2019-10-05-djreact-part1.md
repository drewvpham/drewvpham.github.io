# Django and React Part 1!

I stumbled across a tutorial walking through a Django and React web application. The first video is about 50 minutes long and focuses primarily on downloading the necessary tools, setting up the environment, and begins building the application. This has been a great refresher for me since it has definitely been a while since I used React. I am excited to brush up and carrying this forward in the future! More blog posts to come!
