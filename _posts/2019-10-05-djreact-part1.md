I stumbled across a tutorial walking through a Django and React web application. The first [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZgRbnIsgrA) is about 50 minutes long and focuses primarily on downloading the necessary tools, setting up the environment, and begins building the application. This has been a great refresher for me since it has definitely been a while since I used React. The video tutorial utilizes Django's REST framework which I thought was pretty interesting. I have never used the REST framework before.

My only complaint on this video series is that the creator does not go into much detail of what things are and why its necessary. So I will need to review things and research further. But I suppose that is also a good thing!

I am excited to brush up and carrying this forward in the future! More blog posts to come!
